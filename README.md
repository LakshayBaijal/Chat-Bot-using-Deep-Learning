Packages of NLTP and Torch,Numpy,JSON

NLTP has Utilities mostly unsupervised methods which Tokenizes (Divides String to List) , Stems (Trims the words to get origin of the word) 
, Bag of Words (Extracts Features and uses booleans which filters words for Response.

Torch has function on feedforward Neural Networks which provides path for input,hidden,output and terminates them.
The information moves in only one direction.Torch.nn provides all the building blocks to build your own neural network.
