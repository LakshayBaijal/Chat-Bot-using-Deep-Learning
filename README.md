Packages of NLTP and Torch,Numpy,JSON

NLTP has Utilities mostly unsupervised methods which Tokenizes (Divides String to List) , Stems (Trims the words to get origin of the word) 
, Bag of Words (Extracts Features and uses booleans which filters words for Response.

Torch has function on feedforward Neural Networks which provides path for input,hidden,output and terminates them.
The information moves in only one direction.Torch.nn provides all the building blocks to build your own neural network.
It keeps track of the currently selected GPU, and all CUDA tensors you allocate will by default be created on that device.



JSON stores the Intents(Tags,Patterns,Responses) so that it's suitable for storing or transmitting across network

Data.pth stores model state,input,output,hidden paths by training and its loaded for evaluation.
